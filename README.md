# Gamecore

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## CLI

```bash
python -m scripts.run_cli --seed 123
```

## GUI

```bash
python -m scripts.run_gui
```

## Saves & Config

Game data is stored inside the user's home directory in `~/.oko_zombie`.
Configuration options are kept in `config.json` and individual saves reside
in the `saves/` subdirectory.  The save files include a `save_version` field
so future releases can detect incompatible formats.

From the game you can quick save with **F5** and quick load with **F9**. The
game also performs an automatic save after each turn.

The **Settings** menu exposes basic options like volume, language, window
size and fullscreen state.  Changing these values writes them to
`config.json` for the next session.

## Tiles pipeline

Tile graphics are generated from `textures.json`. Run the helper script to
build individual 64Ã—64 tiles and an atlas:

```bash
python tools/build_tiles.py
```

The client also checks `assets/tiles/` on startup and will automatically
invoke this script if the directory is empty, producing fallback tiles from
the JSON mapping.

## Localization

Text shown by both the CLI and the GUI is translated via a simple JSON based
system. Locale files live in `data/locales/<lang>.json` and the desired
language is stored in `~/.oko_zombie/config.json` under the `"lang"` key.
Missing keys default to the lookup key itself.

## Tests

```bash
pytest -q
```
