"""Tiny board and game state helpers used by the tests.

The original project ships with a large and feature rich implementation.  For
unit tests we only require a lightâ€‘weight subset that can create a board,
perform very small path finding and keep track of a couple of players.  The
functions implemented here intentionally mirror the API of the real project so
other modules (``rules`` and ``validate``) can interact with it without pulling
in heavy dependencies.
