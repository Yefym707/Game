"""Player entity used by the simplified campaign module.

This module originally provided only a very small ``Player`` class which kept
track of a position and a health value.  For the text based game to be useful
in unit tests a couple of additional features are required: a name, an
inventory for items and some helpers to modify the player's state.  The class
below stays intentionally lightweight but offers a convenient API that mirrors
the expectations of the surrounding code base.
