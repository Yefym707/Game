        The board is represented as a 2D list where the first dimension
        corresponds to ``y`` (rows) and the second to ``x`` (columns).  The
        zombie will move horizontally or vertically by a single tile towards
        the closest player.  If the zombie starts its turn adjacent to a
        player it deals one point of damage instead of moving.

        Parameters
        ----------
        players_list:
            Iterable of player objects.  A player is expected to expose ``x``,
            ``y`` and ``take_damage`` attributes.
        game_board:
            2D board used to keep the zombie inside bounds.  The structure of
            the board itself is irrelevant â€“ only its dimensions are used.
